<h2>Node JS!</h2>
<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. </p>

Node is essential to work in a runtime environment as it processes the requests it receives in the code as an event loop. The JavaScript ecosystem is a versatile environment for app development. With the Node JS tool, you can handle it easily using Vue JS, Gulp, Sublime text, UIs, and connectors. JavaScript and Node together allow us to create an easily accessible web server by running a small section of codes. But, there are some myths about Node JS development on the Internet, which need to be busted, such are mentioned below.</p>      </div>
