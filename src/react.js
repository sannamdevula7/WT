        <p>React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. React is a tool for building UI components.
        Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
        React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed. You will learn the various aspects of how React does this in the rest of this tutorial.
